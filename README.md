##About the Project

This project,I called as weatime, is part of my studies and portfolio. Here the goal was to learn how to request the location, and make and API request from [Open Weather Map Current Weather Data API](https://openweathermap.org/current#parameter)

First is requested to the user to allow to collect your location and from the latitute and longitute is possible to fecth the weather data.

It has four backgorund using **Linear Gradient** and it changes in accordance with the main weather response from the API:
* Rain and Thunderstorm;
* Clouds and Mist;
* Snow;
* All the others.

The icon will change as well following the weather's charactristic.

In case to use a simulator, it's necessary to set the latitude and longitude to where you wish to get the weather.
